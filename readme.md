## School Management and Accounting Software

We like to challenge the quality of what we build to make it better. To do so we try to make the product simple to use, make the design beautiful and user friendly. Innovation and hardwork help to fulfill these requirements. I believe inorder to innovate we need to think differently. A few months ago I came across that there was no open source free School Management software that met the quality I wanted. I happen to know a bit of programming so I decided to make one. I also believe that working with more people can push the standard higher than working alone. So I decied to make it open source and free.

This software has following features:

- Attendance
- Mark
- Registration
- Notice, Syllabus
- Library
- Exam
- Grade
- Accounts
- Messaging
